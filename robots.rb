# A robot instance should have a method called 'say_hi' and it should return "Hi!"
# A robot instance should have a method called 'say_name' and it should return "My name is X" where X is the robot's name
# Define a BendingUnit class
# A BendingUnit inherits from Robot
# A bending unit instance has a method called 'bend'
# The bend method has one argument 'objecttobend'
# The bend method should put to the console "Bend X!" where X is objecttobend

# An ActorUnit inherits from Robot
# An ActorUnit instance has a method called 'change_name'
# The 'changename' method accepts an argument 'newname'
